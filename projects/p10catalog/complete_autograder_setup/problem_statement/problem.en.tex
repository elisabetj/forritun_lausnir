\problemname{Catalog}

In this project, you implement two classes: 
\texttt{Item} in the file \texttt{item.py} and \texttt{Catalog} in the file \texttt{catalog.py}.  
\begin{itemize}
    \item The constructor for \texttt{Item} accepts two string parameters. The first one denotes the name of the item and the second denotes the item's category.
    \item The constructor for \texttt{Catalog} accepts one string parameter, denoting the name of the catalog.
    \item \texttt{Catalog} keeps track of a collection of \texttt{Item}. The collection you decide to use needs to maintain insertion order.
    \item Both \texttt{Item} and \texttt{Catalog} contain several instance methods. 
    The methods in \texttt{Catalog} and \texttt{Item} will be tested using unit tests. 
    You should be able to figure out what methods are needed, by inspecting the following main program and its output:
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
from item import Item
from catalog import Catalog

item1 = Item("Green Book", "Biography")
print(item1)

item2 = Item("The God", "Crime")
print(item2)
item2.set_name("The Godfather")
print(item2)

item3 = Item("Schindler's List", "Biography")
print(item3)
item3.set_category("Drama")
print(item3)

catalog = Catalog("Films")
catalog.add(item1)
catalog.add(item2)
catalog.add(item3)
print(catalog)

catalog.remove(item2)
print(catalog)

catalog.set_name("Favorite Movies")
print(catalog)

catalog.clear()
print(catalog)
\end{verbatim}

\section*{Output}
The output from the main program is the following: 
\begin{verbatim}
Name: Green Book, Category: Biography
Name: The God, Category: Crime
Name: The Godfather, Category: Crime
Name: Schindler's List, Category: Biography
Name: Schindler's List, Category: Drama
Catalog Films:
        Name: Green Book, Category: Biography
        Name: The Godfather, Category: Crime
        Name: Schindler's List, Category: Drama
Catalog Films:
        Name: Green Book, Category: Biography
        Name: Schindler's List, Category: Drama
Catalog Favorite Movies:
        Name: Green Book, Category: Biography
        Name: Schindler's List, Category: Drama
Catalog Favorite Movies:
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{Note:} When individual \texttt{Item} for a given \texttt{Catalog} are printed, one tab-character appears at the start of each line.
You should \textbf{not} submit the main program as part of your solution, only the files \texttt{item.py} and \texttt{catalog.py}.
