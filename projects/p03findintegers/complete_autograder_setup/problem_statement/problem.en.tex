\problemname{Find Integers}

Write a program that: 
\begin{enumerate} 
    \item Finds and prints all positive two digit integers strictly less than \texttt{stop\_range}, whose square of the sum of its digits is equal to the original integer.
   \item Finds and prints all positive integers strictly less than \texttt{stop\_range}, with exactly \texttt{num\_divisors} positive divisors.
\end{enumerate}

The repititions in the program should be implemented using \textbf{for loops}.
Make sure you think about and write down an \textbf{algorithm} for the problem before you start coding!

\section*{Input}
The input consists of two lines: 

The first line contains one integer, $20 \leq$ \texttt{stop\_range} $\leq 100$. 

The second line contains one integer, $1 \leq$ \texttt{num\_divisors} $\leq 12$. \\

\section*{Output}
The output consists of $n \ge 0$ lines and each line contains a single integer. \\
The first part of the output contains the integers found according to item 1 above. \\
The second part of the output contains the integers found according to item 2 above. \\
