\problemname{Chess Pieces}

The following table shows the integer value of the various chess pieces (the king does not have a value):

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ |c|c| }
\hline
\textbf{Piece} & \textbf{Value} \\ 
\hline
Queen & 9 \\ 
Rook & 5 \\ 
Bishop & 3 \\
Knight & 3 \\
Pawn & 1 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Write a program that reads a single integer value and prints out the name of the chess piece associated with the given value. 
If there are more than one such chess piece, you should output the names of all of them, with the word ``or'' separating the names.

Note: Remember to use descriptive names for your variables.
The mathematical symbols used here are not suggestions for variable names.

\section*{Input}
The input consists of a single line, containing an integer $v$, with $0 \leq v \leq 10$.

Note: Your program is not supposed to validate this input, or refuse other input.
This is just for your information about the input in the test cases.
You do not need to expect input that does not meet these restrictions.

\section*{Output}
The output consists of a single line showing the name of the chess piece (pieces) associated with the given value,
or the string ``No piece'' if a value is input that cannot be associated with a chess piece.
