\problemname{Join two files}

Write a program that reads two text files and prints out their lines interleaved. The two files don't necessarily have to have the same number of lines.

Assuming that we have two files with the following contents:

\texttt{A.TXT}
\begin{verbatim}
    Line 1
    Line 2
    Line 3
    Line 4
\end{verbatim}

\texttt{B.TXT}
\begin{verbatim}
    alpha
    beta
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{Note:} The program should print out the lines from the two files interleaved as shown below:

\begin{verbatim}
    Line 1
    alpha
    Line 2
    beta
    Line 3
    Line 4
\end{verbatim}

\section*{Input}
Input consists of:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Two filenames containing the text to be interleaved.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Output}
Output consists of:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The interleaved content of the two files, where each line from the first file is followed by a line from the second file (if available).
\end{enumerate}
