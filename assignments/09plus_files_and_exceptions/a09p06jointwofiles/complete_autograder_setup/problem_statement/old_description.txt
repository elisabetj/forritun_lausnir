Title: Join two files

Write a program that reads two text files and prints out their lines interleaved.
The two files don't necessarily have to have the same number of lines.

Assuming that we have two files with the following contents:

A.TXT
-----
    Line 1
    Line 2
    Line 3
    Line 4

B.TXT
-----
    alpha
    beta

then the program should print out the following:
    Line 1
    alpha
    Line 2
    beta
    Line 3
    Line 4
