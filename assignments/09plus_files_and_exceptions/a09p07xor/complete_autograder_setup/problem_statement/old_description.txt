Title: XOR

Write a program that:
1. Prompts the user for a file name.
2. Opens the file in binary mode, using the "rb" mode of the open function.
    - If the file does not exist, then the program should print "No file named {file name} could be found".
3. Calculates an XOR checksum by performing byte-wise XOR operations for every byte in the file.
4. Prints out "The checksum is <checksum>" where checksum is a single byte in hexadecimal format (e.g. xB2)

Example:
Let's assume that the file a.bin contains three bytes:
- 0x01, 0x02 and 0x01.
Then the XOR checksum is
- 0x01 ^ 0x02 ^ 0x01 = 0x02.
