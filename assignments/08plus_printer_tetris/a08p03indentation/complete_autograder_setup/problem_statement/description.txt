Title: Indentation

Having printed out your code, you realize that the indentation is all wrong. You need to fix this.

Write a function named change_indentation() that takes two arguments:

- text: a string, possibly containing several lines
- spaces: an integer, the number of spaces to add (if positive) or remove (if negative)

The function should change the indentation for every line in the supplied string.
Moreover, it should be smart enough so that it:

1. never removes more from the front of a line than is possible without clipping the text
2. never adds more indentation than is possible while ensuring that no line exceeds 80 characters.

In cases where the function needs to adjust the number of spaces to add/remove to satisfy the aforementioned constraints,
it should add/remove the same number of spaces for every line.

Following is an excerpt from an IPython session in which this function is used.
Notice how it doesn't clip the text when asked to remove spaces that are not there
and how it only adds 2 spaces when asked to add 100 spaces to honor the 80 character limit.

In [5]: text = """x = 1
   ...: my_function(x)"""

In [6]: print(change_indentation(text, 4))
    x = 1
    my_function(x)

In [7]: print(change_indentation(text, 8))
        x = 1
        my_function(x)

In [8]: print(change_indentation(text, -2))
x = 1
my_function(x)

In [9]: text = "#\n" + "#" * 78

In [10]: print(change_indentation(text, 100))
  #

In [11]: text = """    hello
    ...:     reykjavik
    ...:     university"""

In [12]: print(change_indentation(text, -2))
  hello
  reykjavik
  university
