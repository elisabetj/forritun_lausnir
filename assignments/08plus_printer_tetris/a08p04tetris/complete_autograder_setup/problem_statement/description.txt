Title: Tetris!

You make a rather profound realization whilst taking a shower.
Using your two functions, rotate_text_clockwise() and change_indentation(), you should be able to make a crude ASCII-art version of Tetris!
Well, at least you could "draw" one block, move it left or right and rotate it.
You rush back to your desk to hack together a prototype.

You decide to start by "drawing" one piece using X's like so:

X
XXX

You then add a loop that repeatedly asks the user what to do. The options are:
(r)ight, (l)eft, (t)urn, (q)uit
and the user only has to type in the first letter of the available commands, followed by pressing Enter.

You then implement these actions leveraging the functions that you have already built.
And you're done! You sit back and quietly reflect on this moment of synergy, as you test your delightful little prototype.

X
XXX
(r)ight, (l)eft, (t)urn, (q)uit: r
 X
 XXX
(r)ight, (l)eft, (t)urn, (q)uit: r
