Title: Printer from Hell

One day, your printer loses the plot and starts printing text from the bottom left corner and upwards, rather than from the top left corner and to the right.
Yet the characters are correctly oriented. When you attempt to print out:

Hey printer,
what's wrong
with you?

it comes out as:

,g
rn
eo
tr?
nwu
i o
rsy
p'
 th
yat
ehi
Hww

This puts you in a bit of a pickle. You have a small programming assignment that you need to hand in.
The professor is old and eccentric and insists that his students print out their solutions.
You need to find a way to correct for your printer's dementia.
You realize that if you "rotate" your text 90 degrees clockwise before printing it, then it prints out correctly.

Write a function that takes a string as input and returns another string in which the words read downwards, starting from the right-most line.
Examples of use from IPython:

In [2]: original_text = """123
   ...: 456
   ...: 789"""

In [3]: print(rotate_text_clockwise(original_text))
741
852
963

In [4]: original_text = """ABC
   ...: DE
   ...: F"""

In [5]: print(rotate_text_clockwise(original_text))
FDA
 EB
  C
