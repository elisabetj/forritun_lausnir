\problemname{Permutative Numbers}

Let us say two numbers are permutations of each other
if it is possible to rearrange the digits of one to get the other.

Furthermore, let $n$ be a number, and let $d$ be the number of digits in $n$.
Let us say that $n$ is \emph{permutative} if all of its first $d$ multiples are permutations of $n$.

For example, let $n = 1035$.
Then we have $d = 4$, and the first $4$ multiples of $n$ are:
\begin{align*}
	1 \cdot 1035 = 1035 \\
	2 \cdot 1035 = 2070 \\
	3 \cdot 1035 = 3105 \\
	4 \cdot 1035 = 4140
\end{align*}
Even though one of those, $3 \cdot 1035 = 3105$, is a permutation of $1035$,
the number $1035$ is not permutative, since not all of the four multiples are permutations of $1035$.

On the other hand, let $n = 142857$.
It has $d = 6$ digits, and its first $6$ multiples are
\begin{align*}
	1 \cdot 142857 = 142857 \\
	2 \cdot 142857 = 285714 \\
	3 \cdot 142857 = 428571 \\
	4 \cdot 142857 = 571428 \\
	5 \cdot 142857 = 714285 \\
	6 \cdot 142857 = 857142
\end{align*}
All of these numbers are permutations of $142857$, hence $142857$ is permutative.

Write a program that, given an integer $s$, prints all permutative numbers from 10 up to $s$ inclusive.

The program should be split into functions,
with a function called \texttt{is\_permutative(n)},
which takes a parameter $n$
and returns \texttt{True} or \texttt{False} based on whether $n$ is permutative.

Hint: You can convert an integer to a string to get a string of digits,
and then the length of the string is the number of digits in the integer.

\section*{Input}
Input consists of one line, containing the integer $s$, where $10 \leq s \leq 10^6$.

\section*{Output}
Output consists of $l$ lines, where $l$ is the number of permutative numbers from $10$ to $s$.
The $i$-th line of the output should contain the $i$-th permutative number.
