Title: Permutative numbers

Let us say two numbers are permutations of each other
if it is possible to rearrange the digits of one to get the other,
as in the previous question.

Now, let us furthermore call a number n "permutative"
if all its first d multiples are permutations of n,
where d is the number of digits of n.
Example:
1035 has 4 digits, and its first 4 multiples are:
    1 * 1035 = 1035
    2 * 1035 = 2070
    3 * 1035 = 3105
    4 * 1035 = 4140
Even though one of those, 3 * 1035 = 3105, is a permutation of 1035,
the number 1035 is not permutative, since not all of the four multiples are permutations of 1035.

On the other hand, 142857 has 6 digits, and its first 6 multiples are:
    1 * 142857 = 142857
    2 * 142857 = 285714
    3 * 142857 = 428571
    4 * 142857 = 571428
    5 * 142857 = 714285
    6 * 142857 = 857142
All of these are permutations of 142857, so 142857 is permutative.

Write a program that prints all permutative numbers from 10 up to a number input by the user.

The program should be split into functions,
with a function called is_permutative(n), which returns True or False based on whether n is permutative.

Hint: You can convert an integer to a string to get a string of digits, and then the length of the string is the number of digits in the integer.
