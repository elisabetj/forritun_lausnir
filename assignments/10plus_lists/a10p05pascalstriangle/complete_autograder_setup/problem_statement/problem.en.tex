\problemname{Pascal's triangle}

Write a Python program that asks for the height of a
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal's\_triangle}{Pascal's triangle}
then generates the triangle and prints it out.

A Pascal triangle of height $6$ looks like this:
\begin{verbatim}
                1
             1     1
           1    2    1
         1   3     3   1
       1   4    6    4   1
     1   5   10   10   5   1
\end{verbatim}
Rules to generate Pascal's triangle:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The first row is always $1$, and the second row is always $1$ $1$.
    \item After the first two rows, each row at level $h$ is generated from the values at row $h-1$.
\end{enumerate}
The leftmost number and the rightmost number in any row are always $1$.
Note that, in row $h$, there are $h$ numbers.

The main program is given, but you need to implement the function \texttt{make\_new\_row(row)}.
It should take one list as an argument, one row of Pascal's triangle,
and return a list, the next row in Pascal's triangle.

For example the expected output of a call to \texttt{make\_new\_row()}
with \texttt{[1, 1]} as the parameter,
is \texttt{[1, 2, 1]}.

\section*{Input}

The input consists of one line containing one integer $h$, the height of the triangle, where $0 \leq h \leq 100$.

\section*{Output}

The output consists of $h$ lines, where the $i$th line contains the $i$th level of Pascal's Triangle.
Each level should be output in Python list notation.
