Title: Pascal's triangle

Write a Python program that asks for the height of a
[Pascal's triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal's_triangle),
then generates the triangle and prints it out.

A Pascal triangle of height 6 looks like this:
                1
             1     1
           1    2    1
         1   3     3   1
       1   4    6    4   1
     1   5   10   10   5   1

Pascal’s triangle rules:
1. To generate the triangle, you start from the first row, which is always 1, and the second row which is always 1 1.
2. After the first two rows, each row at level h is generated from the values at row h-1.
Note that the leftmost number and the rightmost number in any row are always 1. Note that, in row h, there are h numbers.

The main program is given, but you need to implement the function make_new_row().

For example, the following is the output of a call to make_new_row():
    >>> make_new_row([1,1])
    [1, 2, 1]

Example input output from the program:
    Height of Pascal's triangle (n>=1): 4
    [1]
    [1, 1]
    [1, 2, 1]
    [1, 3, 3, 1]
