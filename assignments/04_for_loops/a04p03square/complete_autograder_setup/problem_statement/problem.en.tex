\problemname{Square, but Not the Math Kind}

Write a program that, given an integer $d$, prints a square made out of asterisks.

The square has space separated \texttt{*} symbols on its edges and is filled with spaces on the inside.

\section*{Input}
Input consists of one line containing the integer $d$, where $1 \leq d \leq 100$.

\section*{Output}
Output consists of the $d$ lines needed to form the square.
Your output must be exactly correct, with no additional whitespace.
In particular, there should be no spaces at the end of each line.
