\problemname{Fancy Multiplication}

Let us assume that Python does not have a multiplication operator.

Write a program that implements multiplication by using addition and a loop.

\section*{Input}
Input consists of two lines. \\
The first line contains the first integer $x$, where $0 \leq x \leq 10^6$. \\
The second line contains the second integer $y$, where $0 \leq y \leq 10^6$. \\

\section*{Output}
Output consists of one line, containing the result of the multiplication of $x$ and $y$.
