Will things ever be the same again?

Write a program that, given an integer $n$ as input, prints $n$, then $n-1$, and so forth, until finally printing $1$, at which point the program exits.

\section*{Input}
Input consists of one line containing the integer $n$, where $1 \leq n \leq 10^4$.

\section*{Output}
Output consists of $n$ lines, each line containing one integer.
