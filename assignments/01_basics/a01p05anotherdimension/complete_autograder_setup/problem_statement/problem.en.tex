\illustration{0.3}{sphere}{A sphere}

Time to take your brains to another dimension. Pay close attention!

The volume of a sphere can be calculated as $V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3$.

Now imagine we have a hemisphere, also known as a half-sphere, so a sphere where one half has been removed.

Given the diameter of the original sphere, output the volume of the half-sphere.
Note that the diameter of a sphere is defined as double the radius of the same sphere.

Hint: you can use the \texttt{pi} variable in the \texttt{math} module.

\section*{Input}
Input consists of one line with one floating point number $d$, the diameter of the sphere, where $0 \leq d \leq 1000$.
It is guaranteed that the number is given with at most two digits after the decimal point.

\section*{Output}
Output consists of one line with one floating point number, the volume of the half-sphere.
The output number should have an absolute or relative error of at most $10^{-9}$.
