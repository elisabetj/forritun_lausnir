\problemname{A Shortcut to What?}

Write a program that reads an integer $n$ from the input.
The program should add five to $n$, then triple the value and finally subtract ten.
You are welcome to simplify the formula if you can, as long as the program gives the correct results.

\section*{Input}
Input consists of one line containing one integer $n$, where $-1\,000 \leq n \leq 1\,000$.

\section*{Output}
Output consists of one line containing one integer, the value computed from $n$ as described above.
