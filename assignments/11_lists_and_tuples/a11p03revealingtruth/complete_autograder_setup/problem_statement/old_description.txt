Title: Revealing truth

Write a function, list_to_bool_tuple(),
that takes a list as a parameter, converts every element in the list to a boolean
and then returns a tuple consisting of these boolean elements.

Any value can be interpreted as a boolean in Python,
e.g. the empty string (written as "") would be interpreted as False (e.g. by writing bool("")),
while any other string would be interpreted as True.

Any integers encountered should be converted to int, before being evaluated to their truth value.

The main program is given - DO NOT change it.

Example1:

    Enter elements of list separated by commas: Hello,20,0, 
    (True, True, False, False)

Example2:

    Enter elements of list separated by commas: 0,,,
    (False, False, False, False)

Note: The function list_to_bool_tuple can receive a list, whose elements are either integers or strings (or a mix of both).
