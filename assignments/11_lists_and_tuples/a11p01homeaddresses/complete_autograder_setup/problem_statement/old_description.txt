Title: Home addresses

Write a program that continuously asks the user for home addresses, one at a time until the user types in 'q' to stop.
The program should put the addresses into a list and then process the list into a list of tuples containing the street name and number.
Display the list and the tuple list.

Note: We will only test addresses that consist of a single word, and an integer, separated by a space.

Example of input/output:
    Home address: Menntavegur 1 
    Home address: Dúfnahólar 10 
    Home address: Bankastræti 5 
    Home address: q
    ['Menntavegur 1', 'Dúfnahólar 10', 'Bankastræti 5']
    [('Menntavegur', '1'), ('Dúfnahólar', '10'), ('Bankastræti', '5')]
