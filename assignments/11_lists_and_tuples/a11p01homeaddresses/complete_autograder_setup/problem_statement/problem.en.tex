\problemname{Home Addresses}

Write a program that continuously asks the user for home addresses, 
one at a time until the user types in ``\texttt{q}'' to stop.
The program should put the addresses into a list and then process 
the list into a list of tuples containing the street name and number.
Display the list and the tuple list.

\section*{Input}
First, the program should prompt the user for a home address,
this prompt then repeats until the user inputs ``\texttt{q}''.

In other words, the program should expect the input to be
a sequence of $n$ lines containing home addresses,
followed by a final line containing the single character ``\texttt{q}'',
making up $n + 1$ lines in total, where $n \ge 0$.

In the tests the addresses will be restricted to a single word 
and an integer, seperated by a space.

A word is defined as a series of English or Icelandic letters,
each word is composed of $3$ to $15$ letters,
and each integer is composed of $1$ to $4$ digits with no leading zeroes.

\section*{Output}
The output should consist of two lines.
The first line should contain a list of all addresses input.
The second line should contain a list of tuples where each address has been split up into a tuple of ``\texttt{(word, integer)}''.
