Title: Sum of primes

Write a function, prime_sum, that takes a list L of integers as an argument
and uses LIST COMPREHENSION to return the sum of all prime numbers from the list L.

Hint: In your implementation, you can use some of the list functions discussed on page 349 in the textbook.

You are given the function is_prime(n) to check whether the number n is prime or not (the function returns a boolean).

The main function and two other functions are given - DO NOT change it.

For example:
    Enter elements of list seperated by commas: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11
    28
