\problemname{Sum of Primes}

Write a function, \texttt{prime\_sum}, that takes a list of integers
and returns the sum of all prime numbers in the list.

Hint: using \emph{list comprehensions} here could prove to be useful.
Additionally you should take a look at some of the list functions discussed in the textbook. 

You are given the function \texttt{is\_prime(n)} to check whether a given number $n$ is prime or not, 
the function returns a boolean.

\textbf{The main file, which handles input and output, is already provided. -
Please only submit your function definitions, without any code outside the functions!}

\section*{Input}
The function recieves one parameter,
a list of integers $l$.

In the tests, $l$ will be of length $1 \le |l| \le 100$,
each integer $l_i$ in the list will be restricted to $1 \le l_i \le 100\,000$.

In the samples below,
the first and only line of the input contains a sequence of integers each sperated by a comma.
The autograder will take this sequence, split it into the list $l$,
converting each number to \texttt{int}, and pass it to your function.

\section*{Output}
The function should return the sum of all primes in the list $l$.

In the samples below,
the first and only line of the output contains this sum.
