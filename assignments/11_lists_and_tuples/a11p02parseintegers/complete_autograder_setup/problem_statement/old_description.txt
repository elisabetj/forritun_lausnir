Title: Parse integers

Write a function, list_to_int_tuple(), that takes a list as a parameter,
converts every element in the list to an integer and then returns a tuple consisting of these integer elements.

If the function encounters elements that cannot be converted to integers, it ignores them.

The main program is given - DO NOT change it.

Hint: Use try-except and the int() constructor.

Example1:

    Enter elements of list separated by commas: 1,2,3,4
    (1, 2, 3, 4)

Example2:

    Enter elements of list separated by commas: 1,2,d,5
    (1, 2, 5)
