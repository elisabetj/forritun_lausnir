\problemname{Scores}

Write a Python program that takes a sequence of real numbers,
removes the three lowest numbers and prints out the sum of the remaining numbers.

An error message should be printed if the number of floats entered is $< 3$, but no other error handling is needed.

Hint: Built-in functions can be of great help!
On the other hand, you do not need to import anything,
and should not use any import statement.

\section*{Input}
The program recieves one line as input,
a sequence $x = (x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n)$ of $n$ real numbers seperated by spaces.

In the tests, $x$ will be of length $n$, with $1 \le n \le 200$,
where each $x_i$ will satisfy $0.0 \le x_i \le 100.0$ for $1 \le i \le n$,
and each number $x_i$ will be given with at most one digit after the decimal point.

In the samples below, the first and only line of the input contains the sequence $x$.

\section*{Output}
The output should consist of either:
\begin{itemize}
    \item
    The string ``\texttt{At least 3 scores needed!}'',
    if fewer than three scores were input.

    \item
    The string ``\texttt{Sum of scores (3 lowest removed): \{$s$\}}''
    where $s$ is the sum of of all the numbers in the sequence $x$
    except the lowest three,
    if three or more scores were input.

    The sum should be rounded to one digit after the decimal point.
\end{itemize}
