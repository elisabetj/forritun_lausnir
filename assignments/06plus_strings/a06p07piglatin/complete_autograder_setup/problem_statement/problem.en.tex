\problemname{Pig Latin}

\illustration{0.3}{pigs}{pigs}

You are trying to have a private conversation with your best friend, but your annoying baby brother is eavesdropping.
To thwart that little brat, you decide to converse in Pig Latin!
However, your Pig Latin is not very fluid so you need to write a program to help you translate English to Pig Latin.

The rules for translating from English to Pig Latin are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item If a word begins with a vowel,
    append \texttt{yay} to the end of the word.
\item If a word begins with a consonant,
    remove all the consonants from the beginning up to the first vowel
    and append them to the end of the word.
    Finally, append \texttt{ay} to the end of the word.
\end{enumerate}

We will consider the following letters to be vowels: \texttt{a, e, i, o, u, y}

For example:
\begin{itemize}
    \item dog $\rightarrow$ ogday
    \item scratch $\rightarrow$ atchscray
    \item is $\rightarrow$ isyay
    \item apple $\rightarrow$ appleyay
\end{itemize}

\section*{Input}
Input consists of one line with $n$ space separated words, where $0 \leq n \leq 1000$, that should be translated.
Each word will consist at least $1$ and at most $20$ lowercase English letters and will contain at least one vowel.

\section*{Output}
Output consists of one line with every word from the input translated to Pig Latin, in the same order they appear in the input and separated by spaces.
