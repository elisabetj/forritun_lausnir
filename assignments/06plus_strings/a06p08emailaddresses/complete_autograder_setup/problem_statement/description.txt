Title: Email Addresses

You have started your own company and are creating
a Software-as-a-Service solution for tracking missing socks,
called where-my-sock.is.
You are currently in a beta phase.
People who are interested in using the product
need to sign up with an email address in order to receive an invite.

You have set up an error monitoring system so that you are notified whenever an error occurs in your software system.
Recently, you have noticed several errors from the email system that sends out the invites.
You investigate and discover that a surprisingly large fraction of people trying to sign up
misspell their email address when they fill out the signup form.
The service you use to send the email messages is very picky about email addresses
[conforming to specification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_address).
This is a bit of a shame because these users are not made aware of their mistake
and instead end up fruitlessly refreshing their inboxes,
never receiving the invite they crave so much.

You decide to do something about this.
You look at the error logs and compile a list of the 8 most common mistakes people make.
They are (in no particular order):

    @ symbol is missing
    There are multiple @ symbols
    There's nothing before the @ symbol
    There's nothing after the @ symbol
    Email address starts with a dot
    There's a dot just before the @ symbol
    There are consecutive dots
    The top-level-domain (.e.g. com) is missing

You intend to add a validator to the signup form
to provide a helpful message to users when they make one of these mistakes,
but first you create a prototype in your favourite programming language - Python.

Here are examples of how you would like your program to detect and point out these common mistakes:

Email address: sock.master.gmail.com
Checking...
@ symbol is missing

Email address: sock.master@gmail@com
Checking...
sock.master@gmail@com
                 ^--there's an extra @ symbol here

Email address: @gmail.com
Checking...
 @gmail.com
^--this bit is missing

Email address: sock.master@
Checking...
sock.master@
            ^--this bit is missing

Email address: .sock.master@gmail.com
Checking...
.sock.master@gmail.com
^--there's a dot here that probably shouldn't

Email address: sock.master.@gmail.com
Checking...
sock.master.@gmail.com
           ^--there's a dot here that probably shouldn't

Email address: sock..master@gmail.com
Checking...
sock..master@gmail.com
    ^--there are consecutive dots here

Email address: sock.master@gmail
Checking...
The top-level-domain is missing. Did you perhaps intend to write sock.master@gmail.com?

Email address: sock.master@gmail.com
Checking...
Seems legit
