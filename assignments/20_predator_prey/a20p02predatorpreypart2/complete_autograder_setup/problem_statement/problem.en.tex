\problemname{Predator Prey Part 2}
You should have noticed that the animals tend to move up and to the left.\\
That is because the ``\texttt{\_check\_grid\_for\_neighbor()}'' method always works through the offsets in the same order.

In this part, you need to add randomness to the direction chosen in the method.
The possible moves are still the same, but the order in which they are checked should be random.

\textbf{Hint}: Check out the ``\texttt{random.shuffle()}'' method.
