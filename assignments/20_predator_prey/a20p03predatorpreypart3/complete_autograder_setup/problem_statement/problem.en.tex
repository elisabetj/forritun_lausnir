\problemname{Predator Prey Part 3}

Now in this last part, you should add functionality to the \texttt{Prey} class.
When the breeding time has occcurred for an instance of \texttt{Prey},
it should now try to create two offsprings as opposed to just one.

Also you should not simply copy code from the \texttt{Animal} class,
but rather refactor the code such that two offsprings can be easily created in the \texttt{Prey} class.
