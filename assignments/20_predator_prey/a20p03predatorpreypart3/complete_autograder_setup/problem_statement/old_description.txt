Title: Part 3

In this last part, you add functionality to the Prey class.
When the breeding time has occcurred for an instance of Prey,
it should now try to create two offsprings as opposed to just one.

You should not simply copy code from the Animal class,
but rather refactor the code such that two offsprings can be easily created in the Prey class.
