\problemname{Range Sum}

Write the function
\texttt{sum\_of\_range(start, end, step)},
which takes in three integers as parameters, 
\texttt{start}, \texttt{end}, and \texttt{step}.
The function should return the sum of
all numbers from \texttt{start} to \texttt{end},
both end points included,
taking \texttt{step} size steps each increment.

Formally, you should compute the value of 
\[
    \sum_{i=0}^{\left \lfloor \frac{b-a}{k} \right \rfloor} a + i \cdot k
\]
where $a$ is the value of \texttt{start},
$b$ is the value of \texttt{end},
and $k$ is the value of \texttt{step}.

\textbf{Note that we are testing your code differently in this task,
please only submit your function definitions, without any code outside the functions!}
The main python file, which handles input and output, is already provided.
You can download and place the main file in the same directory as your python file.
You can then run the main python file we provide to try out the samples.

\section*{Input}
The input to the function will consist of three parameters.\\
The first parameter will be an integer $a$, the start of the sum, where $1 \leq a \leq 2000$.\\
The second parameter will be an integer $b$, the end of the sum, where $s \leq b \leq 2000$.\\
The third parameter will be an integer $k$, size of steps, where $1 \leq k \leq 100$.
You need not verify this.

\section*{Output}
The output of the function should be one integer, the sum over the given range.
