\problemname{Extracting a Number}

Write a function
\texttt{extract\_first\_number\_from\_string(string\_to\_search)}
which takes a string as a parameter.
The function should extract the first number from the string
and return it as an integer,
or return $-1$ if no number was found.

\textbf{Note that we are testing your code differently in this task,
please only submit your function definitions, without any code outside the functions!}
The main python file, which handles input and output, is already provided.
You can download and place the main file in the same directory as your python file.
You can then run the main python file we provide to try out the samples.

\section*{Input}
The input consists of one string which is at least $0$ and at most $100$ symbols,
each of which is either a space, a digit or a letter in the English alphabet.
Note that this means there will not be any sign (plus or minus) in front of any numbers,
only positive integers will be considered.
You need not verify this.

\section*{Output}
The output of the function should be one integer,
the first number contained in the input string,
or $-1$ if no number was found.
