Title: Extracting a number

Write a function extract_first_number_from_string(string) which takes a string as a parameter.
The function should extract the first (non-negative) number from the string and return it, or return -1 if no number was found.

Example:
>>> extract_first_number_from_string("There are 365 or 366 days in the year.")
365

Note: You can disregard negative numbers entirely,
they will also not be tested, and only integers will be tested.

Note: The function should just return an integer, not a string.

Note: we are testing your code differently this week,
please only submit your function definitions, without any code outside the functions!
