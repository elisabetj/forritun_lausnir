Title: Abundant, deficient, or perfect numbers

A number is abundant if the sum of its factors, other than itself, is larger than the number itself,
deficient if the sum of factors is lower, and perfect if the sum of factors equals the number.
For example, 6 is a perfect number because the sum of its factors is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.

Write the function sum_of_factors(n),
which takes a number and sums all its factors (excluding itself).
For example, sum_of_factors(12) should return 16 because 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16.

Now, write a second function, called "decide",
this function receives as a parameter a number, and returns the string
    "{number} is abundant." if the sum of the factors of number are greater than the number itself,
    "{number} is a perfect number." if the sum of the factors of number is equal to the number itself,
    and "{number} is deficient." if the sum of the factors of number is less than the number itself,
where {number} is the number in question.

Note: Only non-negative integers will be tested as input.

Note: we are testing your code differently this week,
please only submit your function definitions, without any code outside the functions!
