Title: Is substring

Write a function called is_substring_of that takes in two strings as arguments
and returns True if the first string is inside the second one.

Hint: There's something in the water.

Example input/output:
>>> is_substring_of("python", "There's a python in my boot!")
True

Note: we are testing your code differently this week,
please only submit your function definitions, without any code outside the functions!
