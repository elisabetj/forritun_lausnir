Title: Lexicographical order

Write a function, precedes(one_string, another_string), that receives two strings as parameters.
The function returns the string that comes first in alphabetical order.
For example, Hungry comes before Starving alphabetically, because h comes before s.
The function should ignore case.

Note: we are testing your code differently this week,
please only submit your function definitions, without any code outside the functions!
