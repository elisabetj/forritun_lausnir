Title: Decimal to binary

Write a Python function decimal_to_binary(decimal) that receives an integer and returns a string with its binary representation.

How do we get a binary string from an integer?
The easiest method uses integer division by 2 on successive quotients and then collects the remainders.
It is best illustrated by an example. Consider the integer 156:

    156 divided by 2 gives the quotient 78 and remainder 0.
    78 divided by 2 gives the quotient 39 and remainder 0.
    39 divided by 2 gives the quotient 19 and remainder 1.
    19 divided by 2 gives the quotient 9 and remainder 1.
    9 divided by 2 gives the quotient 4 and remainder 1.
    4 divided by 2 gives the quotient 2 and remainder 0.
    2 divided by 2 gives the quotient 1 and remainder 0.
    1 divided by 2 gives the quotient 0 and remainder 1.

Stop when reaching a quotient of 0.
The binary equivalent is given by concatenating the remainders, in reverse
(so the last remainder is the most significant bit and the first is the least).
In this example: 10011100

Note: You should implement the above algorithm using a loop and string methods.
