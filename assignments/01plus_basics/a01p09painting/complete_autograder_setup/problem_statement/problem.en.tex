\problemname{Painting the roof}
\illustration{0.3}{roof_platform}{Roof platform}


You are painting your roof.
You have a $10$ liter can of paint that is filled to the brim.
That poses a bit of a problem because you can not put it down on the roof because it is tilted, otherwise the paint will spill.
You decide to build a simple platform on which to place the can of paint.
You already have one piece of plywood that is sized at $50 \mathrm{cm} \times 50 \mathrm{cm}$.
You are going to screw another piece of wood at a right angle at the end of it to make the platform perfectly level while placed on the roof.


You have a cool app on your phone that allows you to measure the roof's angle in degrees, denoted as $\Theta$ in the diagram.
Now it is time to put your programming skills to use to calculate the exact height of the second piece.

Hint: the math module in Python contains commonly used trigonometric functions.



\section*{Input}
Input consists of one line with one integer $d$, the roof's angle in degrees, where $0 \leq d < 90$.

\section*{Output}
Output consists of one line with one floating point number, the height of the second piece, rounded to 1 decimal place.
