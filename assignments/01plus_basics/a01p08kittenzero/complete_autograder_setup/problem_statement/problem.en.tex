\problemname{Kitten Zero}

Your kitten, Zero, has contracted the sniffles.
Zero is a very sociable kitten so you suspect that it may have spread the disease.
You wonder how many kittens are likely to become ill.

You check on \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_reproduction_number}{Wikipedia}
and see that the common cold has a basic reproduction number $R_0$ between 2 and 3.

You grab a napkin and do the math.
Suppose that $R_0$ is 2.

Then Kitten Zero infects two kittens, who each then infect two other kittens and so on and so forth.
After 3 rounds of transmissions the total number of cases is:
$1 + 2 + (2*2) + (2*2*2) = 15$

But what if $R_0$ is 2.5...or 2.7...or 2.67?

\section*{Input}
Input consists of one line with one floating point number $R_0$, the reproduction rate for the infection,
where $2 \leq R_0 \leq 3$. It is guaranteed that the number is given with at most two digits after the decimal point.

\section*{Output}
Output consists of one line with one integer, the total amount of cases, rounded to the nearest kitten.
