Title: Maximum number

Design an algorithm that finds the maximum positive integer input by a user.
The user repeatedly inputs numbers until a negative value is entered.

Make sure that you write up the algorithm before starting to code.
Then implement the algorithm in Python.
Put your algorithmic description as a comment in the program file.

During the design of your algorithm and your implementation, you should use git:
- It's simplest to start with GitHub:
    - Create an account on github.com (if you don't already have it).
    - Create a private repository on Github
    - Follow the instructions (that appear on Github).
        - Pick a name for the repo, for example "Assignment 5"
        - Make the repo private
        - Check the box for making a README file
        - Check the box for making a .gitignore file. Select the python template (you can type py in the search field)
        - You don't really need to protect this homework with a license, so skip that for now
        - Click "Create repository"
    - Once you've created the repo, you should see a green button near the top, labelled "Code". Click it, and copy the url (https, not ssh).
    - Open a terminal. For Windows, we recommend git bash.
    - Navigate to a folder where you want to store the repo on your computer
    - (if you're having trouble accessing the correct drive, you can also open the folder in the GUI, right click, and open "Git Bash Here" or similar)
    - `git clone url-to-repository`
    - If (when) you are prompted to log in, you can use a Personal Access Token as the password.
        - Go to GitHub
        - Click on your profile image in the top-right corner and click settings
        - Under "Developer Settings" (bottom left), click "Personal access tokens".
        - Create a new token, make sure to check the checkbox for "repo", which will also check all the subselections.
        - Set the expiry date after the course is done (90 days is enough).
        - Scroll all the way down, and click "Generate token"
        - Store the generated token somewhere safe. If you lose this token you can never reclaim it (although if you do, you can revoke it and generate a new one).
        - Use this token as your password
    - If this does not work, make sure you have the latest version of git installed and try again
    - `cd` into the folder git creates for you
    - open this folder in VSCode
- Write the text of your algorithm in a file called `max_int.py`.
- Inspect the result of `git status`.
- Use `git add .`Â to move changes to the staging area.
- Commit your changes with `git commit -m "Describe the algorithm"`.
- Then start implementing your algorithm
- During your implementation, make sure you do `git status`, `git add`, and `git commit` regularly.
    - Take care to write good commit messages (in English) that describe what the change involves.
        - Use imperative mood in commit messages. For example, "Fix bug", and not "Fixed bug" or "Fixes bug".
- You can see a log of all your commits with `git log`.
    - Hit 'q' to escape the log interface.
- When you have finished your implementation:
    - Push your changes to the remote repo with `git push`.
    - Inspect your commits on Github.
