\problemname{Sequence}

Design an algorithm that generates the first $n$ numbers in the following sequence: $1, 2, 3, 6, 11, 20, 37, \dots$

\section*{Input}
Input consists of one integer $n$, the length of the sequence that should be generated, where $1 \leq n \leq 100$.

\section*{Output}
Output consists of $i$ lines where the $i-th$ line contains one number, the $i-th$ number in the sequence.
