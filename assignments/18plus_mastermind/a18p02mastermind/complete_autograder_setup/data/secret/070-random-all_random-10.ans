Welcome to Mastermind.
The codemaker has selected a code.
The code is a sequence of four colors. It may contain duplicates.
There are 6 possible colors to choose from:
 - (r)ed
 - (g)reen
 - (b)lue
 - (y)ellow
 - (p)urple
 - (o)range
It's your job to break the code by making a series of guesses.
Each guess consists of four letters corresponding to the colors listed above.
Example: to guess red, green, blue and orange, type rgbo and press Enter.
