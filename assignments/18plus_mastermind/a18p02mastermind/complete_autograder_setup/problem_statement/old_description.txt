Title: Mastermind

In this exercise, you'll implement the classic code breaking game;
[Mastermind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)).
The computer will play the role of the code maker whereas the user takes on the code breaker role.
The expected behavior of the program is best illustrated with an actual game-playing session.

    Welcome to Mastermind.
    The codemaker has selected a code.
    The code is a sequence of four colors. It may contain duplicates.
    There are 6 possible colors to choose from:
    - (r)ed
    - (g)reen
    - (b)lue
    - (y)ellow
    - (p)urple
    - (o)range
    It's your job to break the code by making a series of guesses.
    Each guess consists of four letters corresponding to the colors listed above.
    Example: to guess red, green, blue and orange, type rgbo and press Enter.

    You failed to guess ppyr. Game over :(
    Would you like to play again (y/n)? n

To summarize, the game should:

- Pick a code at random at the start of a game (see starter code below).
- Grant the user 8 attempts to guess the code.
- Provide feedback on how many elements have
  a) the correct color and position and
  b) the correct color but incorrect position.
- Catch and notify the user when the guess is not valid. Invalid guesses don't count.
- Congratulate the user when they guess correctly.
- Tell the user what the actual code was when they fail to guess it.
