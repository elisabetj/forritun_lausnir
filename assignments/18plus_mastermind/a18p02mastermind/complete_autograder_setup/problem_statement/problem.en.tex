In this exercise, you'll implement the classic code breaking game;
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)}{Mastermind}.
The computer will play the role of the code maker whereas the user takes on the code breaker role.

The game should:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Pick a code at random at the start of a game.
    \item Grant the user $8$ attempts to guess the code.
    \item Provide feedback after each guess, on how many elements have:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The correct color and position.
        \item The correct color but incorrect position.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Catch and notify the user when the guess is not valid. Invalid guesses do not count.
    \item Congratulate the user when they guess correctly.
    \item Tell the user what the actual code was when they fail to guess it.
\end{itemize}

The expected behavior of the program is best illustrated with an actual game-playing session as seen in the samples below.
\begin{verbatim}
Welcome to Mastermind.
The codemaker has selected a code.
The code is a sequence of four colors. It may contain duplicates.
There are 6 possible colors to choose from:
- (r)ed
- (g)reen
- (b)lue
- (y)ellow
- (p)urple
- (o)range
It's your job to break the code by making a series of guesses.
Each guess consists of four letters corresponding to the colors listed above.
Example: to guess red, green, blue and orange, type rgbo and press Enter.
