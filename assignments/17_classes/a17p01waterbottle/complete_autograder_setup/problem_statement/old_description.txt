Title: Water Bottle

Write a class WaterBottle which has max capacity and current contents (given in liters).
The corresponding attributes should be called max_capacity and current_contents.
The __init__() method should accept a parameter called max_capacity, with 2 as the default value,
and initialize the current contents to 0L.
The class has 3 methods, in addition to __init__():
1. fill() : Fills the bottle to max capacity.
2. drink(amount) : reduces the contents of the bottle, and returns the extracted amount.
   - If the amount is less than 0, nothing changes (you're not supposed to spit into the bottle).
   - If the amount is more than the current contents, the bottle is emptied.
   - Otherwise the amount is subtracted from the contents.
3. __str__() : Returns a string stating how many liters of water are currently in the bottle (print to 1 decimal places, e.g. "2.3L").

Remember that the __str__() method should never print anything, only return a string.

Example usage:

    bottle = WaterBottle()
    print(bottle)

    bottle.fill()
    print(bottle)

    sip = bottle.drink(-0.1)
    print(f"Received {sip} liters.")
    print(bottle)

    sip = bottle.drink(0.5)
    print(f"Received {sip} liters.")
    print(bottle)

    sip = bottle.drink(10)
    print(f"Received {sip} liters.")
    print(bottle)

And corresponding outputs:

    The bottle currently holds 0.0L of water.
    The bottle currently holds 2.0L of water.
    Received 0 liters.
    The bottle currently holds 2.0L of water.
    Received 0.5 liters.
    The bottle currently holds 1.5L of water.
    Received 1.5 liters.
    The bottle currently holds 0.0L of water.
