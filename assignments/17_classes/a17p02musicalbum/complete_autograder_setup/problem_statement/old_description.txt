Title: Music album

Write a class called MusicAlbum that has the attributes: 'band', 'title' and 'year'.
It has a constructor with 3 parameters.
By default the band name should be "unknown band", title by default should be "unknown" and the year should be "unknown year" by default.

The class has only 2 methods, in addition to __init__():
- set_album(band, title, year) : function that overwrites attributes in the class. If a field is not supplied in the parameter, the default is the same as in the constructor.
- __str__() : function that returns a string representation of the album (see output example below).

Example use case:

    album = MusicAlbum()
    print(album)

    album.set_album("Talking Heads", "Remain in Light", 1980)
    print(album)

    album.set_album("AC/DC", "Back in Black")
    print(album)

    album_beatles = MusicAlbum("The Beatles", "Abbey Road")
    album_london_calling = MusicAlbum(title="London Calling", year=1979)
    album_beyonce = MusicAlbum(band="Beyonce", year=2016)

    print(album_beatles)
    print(album_london_calling)
    print(album_beyonce)

Expected output:

    Album unknown by unknown band, released in unknown year.
    Album Remain in Light by Talking Heads, released in 1980.
    Album Back in Black by AC/DC, released in unknown year.
    Album Abbey Road by The Beatles, released in unknown year.
    Album London Calling by unknown band, released in 1979.
    Album unknown by Beyonce, released in 2016.

Note: It can happen that you might have to overwrite existing data with a default value, when calling set_album.
