\problemname{Music Album}

Write a class called \texttt{MusicAlbum} that has the attributes:
``\texttt{band}'', ``\texttt{title}'' and ``\texttt{year}''.

The class should have $3$ methods:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{\_\_init\_\_(band, title, year)}: 
    Should accept $3$ parmeters, a band name, album title, and a year.
    By default the band name should be ``\texttt{unknown band}'',
    title by default should be ``\texttt{unknown}''
    and the year should be ``\texttt{unknown year}'' by default.

    \item \texttt{set\_album(band, title, year)}:
    Should overwrite attributes in the class.
    If a field is not supplied in the parameter,
    the default is the same as in the constructor.

    \item \texttt{\_\_str\_\_()}:
    Should return a string representation of the album,
    see output example below.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Note:}
It can happen that you might have to overwrite existing data with a default value,
when calling \texttt{set\_album}.

\textbf{Note:}
You should \textbf{not} submit the main program as part of your solution,
only the file that contains the class \texttt{MusicAlbum}.

The following is an example main program.
This example is also included in the supplied ``\texttt{main.py}'' file:
\begin{verbatim}
album = MusicAlbum()
print(album)

album.set_album("Talking Heads", "Remain in Light", 1980)
print(album)

album.set_album("AC/DC", "Back in Black")
print(album)

album_beatles = MusicAlbum("The Beatles", "Abbey Road")
album_london_calling = MusicAlbum(title="London Calling", year=1979)
album_beyonce = MusicAlbum(band="Beyonce", year=2016)

print(album_beatles)
print(album_london_calling)
print(album_beyonce)
\end{verbatim}


\section*{Output}

The following is the corresponding output for the sample program given above:
