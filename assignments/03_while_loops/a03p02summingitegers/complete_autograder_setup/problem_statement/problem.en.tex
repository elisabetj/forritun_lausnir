\problemname{Summing Integers}

Write a program using a while statement, that given a series of numbers as input, adds them up until the input is $10$ and then prints the total.
Without adding the final $10$.

\section*{Input}

Input consists of $n$ lines, where $1 \leq n \leq 1\,000$.
The $i$th line contains one integer $a_i$, where  $0 \leq a_i \leq 100$.
It is guaranteed that $a_n = 10$.

\section*{Output}

Output consists of one line with one integer, the sum of the numbers given excluding the final $10$.
