\problemname{Pip}

In the game Pip,
players take turns counting one number each,
but whenever the number is divisible by $7$
or contains the digit $7$,
then the current player should say \texttt{Pip!} instead,
and then the order of the players is reversed,
so the previous player is next.
If a player says something they're not supposed to,
they lose,
and the game starts over,
beginning with the player who lost.

Now, imagine we know nothing about strings or how to check if they contain a given character.
One way to check if a number contains the digit $7$
is to keep dividing it by $10$, discarding the remainder, until it becomes $0$,
and at each step checking if the last digit (the discarded remainder) is $7$.

Write a program that accepts a positive integer,
and checks if it contains a 7,
using repeated divisions by 10 and remainders.

\section*{Input}

Input consists of one line with one integer number $n$, where $0 \leq n \leq 1\,000\,000$.

\section*{Output}
Output contains one line with either the string \texttt{The number contains 7.} or \texttt{The number does not contain 7.} depending on the results of your program.
