Title: Final grades, part 2/3

Now, the second line of the input file states the maximum points available for each coursework.
In this second stage of the development, you need to extract these maximum points, for the following:

- All the quizzes that have been held in class so far (both individual quizzes and group quizzes)
- All the assignments
- All the extra assignments
- All the homework projects
- Any midterms held so far
- The final exam, if included in the file

These values need to be recorded in an accessible manner.
You could use a dictionary for this purpose, but we'll leave the design decision to you.
It is probably a good idea to store them as numbers though, not strings, so they are ready for further processing.
In this second stage, the program should simply display an overview of this record.
The presentation should be a list of max points along with the column names, as demonstrated in the following output example.
The provided template below includes a function that is intended to save you time on configuring the format, so we recommend that you take a look at it.
This part is really little more than a warm-up for the third part, which is considerably more involved.

The content of a typical input file is rather too vast to fit easily to the page here,
but in the starter code below you can find a file (example input.csv) containing an example of what the first two lines of the file might look like.
The corresponding output is:
