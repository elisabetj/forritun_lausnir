"""A program that prepares to calculate final grades of students in this course.

Takes as input a .csv file exported from the gradebook on Mímir.
We need to extract information for every student on how many points they scored
in individual quizzes, assignments, projects and exams,
as well as the maximum available points for each.

Since not all of those have been performed already,
it is unknown at this time in which order they will appear in the file.
So this program identifies the columns dynamically
(after the semester is over, it would be possible to simplify this program
by providing this mapping as hard-coded constants).

Next, it extracts information from the file, about the maximum available points for each coursework,
and prints it out (nicely formatted), to show an example of what can be done with the results.
