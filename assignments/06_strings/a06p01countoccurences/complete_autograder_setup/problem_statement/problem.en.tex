\problemname{Count Occurrences}

Write a program that, given a string $s$ and a character $c$, prints out the indicies of where $c$ appears in $s$. \\
Note that the program must be case sensitive.
For example, \texttt{M} appears in the string \texttt{Mississippi}, but \texttt{m} does not.

All characters in the input and output are either a letter in the English alphabet, digit, space or punctuation.

\section*{Input}
Input consists of two lines. \\
The first line contains the string $s$. The length of $s$ is at most $10^6$.
The second line contains the character $c$.

\section*{Output}
The output should consist of $l$ lines, where $l$ is the number of times $c$ appears in $s$. \\
The $i$-th line of the output should contain the index of the $i$-th match.
