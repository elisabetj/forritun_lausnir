A Time Limit Exceeded verdict here means your program is doing more work than necessary and does not finish within the time limit.
Try to avoid nested loops, you only need one for loop for this task.
Be careful of slicing within a loop too, the [:] operator on strings, as it will copy the string and create a new one, which is implemented behind the scenes with a loop.
Generally, we are not testing for efficiency at this level, but we want to make you aware of its importance for the distant future.
If you have trouble getting past this test case, please reach out to an instructor for assistance.
