\problemname{Inverse Case}

Write a program that, given a string $s$, inverts the case of every character.
That is to say, if a character is in upper case, turn it into lowercase and if it is in lower case, turn it into upper case.

\section*{Input}
Input consists of one line, the string $s$, which satisifes $1 \leq |s| \leq 10^3$,
where $|s|$ denotes the length of the string $s$.
Each character of the string, except for the trailing newline character, will have an ASCII value between 32 and 126, inclusive.

\section*{Output}
Output consists of one line, containing the case-inversion of $s$.
