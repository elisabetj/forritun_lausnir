Title: Countries

Write a program that reads in a text file supplied by the user,
which contains all (or a subset of) the countries in the world.
The program should repeatedly prompt the user to enter a file name,
until a valid file name is entered.

The program should create a dictionary where the key is an integer
representing the length of a country name and the value is a list of country names
i.e. {16 : ["Marshall Islands", "Papua New Guinea"]}
The program should then repeatedly prompt the user for an integer,
and display all countries with that length separated by commas.

Example Input/Output:

    Enter a filename: Atlantis
    File Atlantis not found!
    Enter a filename: countries.txt
    Enter the length you want to search for: 4
    Chad, Cuba, Fiji, Iran, Iraq, Laos, Mali, Oman, Peru, Togo
    Would you like to continue (y/n)?: y
    Enter the length you want to search for: 16
    Marshall Islands, Papua New Guinea, St Kitts & Nevis
    Would you like to continue (y/n)?: n


countries.txt looks like this:

    Afghanistan
    Albania
    Algeria
    Andorra
    Angola
    ...
    Yemen
    Zambia
    Zimbabwe

Note: countries.txt is supplied in the "Template" section.
