Title: Gradebook

Write a program that repeatedly asks for a student email and a grade.
The email and grade should be stored as a key-value pair in a dictionary.
The grades should be stored in a list inside the dictionary,
so if the same email is entered twice, the new grade should be appended to the list.

In the end, the program should display each email entered along with the average grade corresponding to the email,
the emails should be sorted in alphabetical order.
The grade should be rounded to 2 decimal places.

Example:

    Enter the student email: JohnD@ru.is
    Enter the students grade: 3
    Would you like to add another grade (y/n)?: y
    Enter the student email: JohnD@ru.is
    Enter the students grade: 10
    Would you like to add another grade (y/n)?: y          
    Enter the student email: JohnD@ru.is
    Enter the students grade: 7
    Would you like to add another grade (y/n)?: y
    Enter the student email: MaryC@ru.is
    Enter the students grade: 9
    Would you like to add another grade (y/n)?: y
    Enter the student email: MaryC@ru.is
    Enter the students grade: 8
    Would you like to add another grade (y/n)?: n
    JohnD@ru.is: 6.67
    MaryC@ru.is: 8.5
