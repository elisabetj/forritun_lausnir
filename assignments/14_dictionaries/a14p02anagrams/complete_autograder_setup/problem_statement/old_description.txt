Title: Anagrams

A word is an anagram of another word if the characters in one of the words can be rearranged to form the other word.
We can extend this definition to sentences if we allow spaces between words, and ignore punctuation.

Write a program that prompts the user to input 2 sentences.
The program should then convert the input strings into a dictionary,
where the key is a letter in the sentence, and the value is the count of the character in the sentence.
Do not add punctuation or spaces into the dictionary (HINT: import string.punctuation).

The program should report whether the two sentences are anagrams of each other.

Example input/output:

    Enter a sentence: A gentleman
    Enter another sentence: Elegant man
    A gentleman is an anagram of Elegant man.

Another example:

    Enter a sentence: panama
    Enter another sentence: pan man
    panama is not an anagram of pan man.

Note: The sentences should be compared in a case-insensitive manner,
i.e. do not differentiate between upper case and lower case letters.
