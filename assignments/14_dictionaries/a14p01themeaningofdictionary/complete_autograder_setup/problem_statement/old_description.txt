Title: The meaning of dictionary

Write a program that uses a Python dictionary to implement a dictionary in the usual sense (e.g. English dictionary).
The program should ask the user for a word and then the definition of the word,
and store these inputs into a dictionary as key-value pairs.

The user should be asked: "Would you like to add another word and definition (y/n)?: "
and the process repeated until the user declines.

Finally, the program should display the words in the dictionary in alphabetical order,
along with the corresponding definitions of each.

Note: if the word is already in the dictionary, the old value should be overwritten

Example:

    Enter a word: Hello
    Enter the definition for Hello: an expression or gesture of greeting — used interjectionally in greeting, in answering the telephone, or to express surprise.
    Would you like to add another word and definition (y/n)?: y
    Enter a word: World
    Enter the definition for World: the earth with its inhabitants and all things upon it.
    Would you like to add another word and definition (y/n)?: n

    Hello:
        an expression or gesture of greeting —used interjectionally in greeting, in answering the telephone, or to express surprise

    World:
        the earth with its inhabitants and all things upon it
