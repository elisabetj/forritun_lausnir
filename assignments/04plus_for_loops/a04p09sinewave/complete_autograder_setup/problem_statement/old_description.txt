Title: Sine Wave

Let's attempt to draw a sine wave using the print() statement.
Sine waves are usually drawn horizontally (left to right)
but the print() statement creates output that is ordered from top to bottom.
We'll therefore draw our wave vertically.

Our program shall accept two arguments:

number_of_cycles - which controls how many waves should be drawn
number_of_lines - which controls how many lines are used to print the waves

To draw the wave we simply print a series of "X" characters. Here's an example:

Number of cycles: 1
Stretched over how many lines? 20
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXX
XXXX
X

X
XXXX
XXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXXX

Python has a built in math.sin() function that we will leverage.
To calculate its input, we will consider the lines to be numbered from 0 and onwards.
The distance in radians is then given by:

radians_per_line = number_of_cycles * 2 * math.pi / number_of_lines
radians = line_number * radians_per_line 

math.sin(radians) will return a number between -1.0 and 1.0 inclusive.
We are going to linearly transform the sine value to a number between 0 and 40 (inclusive)
and round that number to figure out how many "X" characters to print.
Here are a few examples:

Sine value              Number of X characters to print
-1.0	                
0.0	                    20
1.0	                    40
0.8414709848078965	    37
