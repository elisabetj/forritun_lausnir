\problemname{Cube of Sum}

Write a program that, given a maximum number $M$ from the user,
finds all integers $n$, such that $0 \leq n \leq M$,
where $n$ equals the cube of the sum of its digits.

The smallest three numbers which satisfy this property are $0$, $1$ and $512$ since $0^3 = 0$, $1^3 = 1$ and $(5+1+2)^3 = 8^3 = 512$.

\section*{Input}
Input consists of one line containing one integer $M$, where $0 \leq M \leq 100\,000$.

\section*{Output}
Output each integer that satisfies the condition on its own line.
You should output the integers in ascending order.
