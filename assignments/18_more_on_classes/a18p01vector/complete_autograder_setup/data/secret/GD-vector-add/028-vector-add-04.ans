Initializing Vector with 1 specified coordinates,
and using default values for the remaining 2 coordinates:
 x = 51
Vector created without errors.
Initializing Vector with 1 specified coordinates,
and using default values for the remaining 2 coordinates:
 x = 59
Vector created without errors.
Vector 1:
[[ 51 0 0 ]]
Vector 2:
[[ 59 0 0 ]]
Result of adding [[ 51 0 0 ]] and [[ 59 0 0 ]] together:
[[ 110 0 0 ]]
