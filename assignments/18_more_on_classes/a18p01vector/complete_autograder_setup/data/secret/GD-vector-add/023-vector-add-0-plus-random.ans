Initializing Vector with 0 specified coordinates,
and using default values for the remaining 3 coordinates:
Vector created without errors.
Initializing Vector with 1 specified coordinates,
and using default values for the remaining 2 coordinates:
 x = 29
Vector created without errors.
Vector 1:
[[ 0 0 0 ]]
Vector 2:
[[ 29 0 0 ]]
Result of adding [[ 0 0 0 ]] and [[ 29 0 0 ]] together:
[[ 29 0 0 ]]
