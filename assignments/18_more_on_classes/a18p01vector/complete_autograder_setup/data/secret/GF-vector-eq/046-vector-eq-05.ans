Initializing Vector with 2 specified coordinates,
and using default values for the remaining 1 coordinates:
 x = -77
 y = -39
Vector created without errors.
Initializing Vector with 3 specified coordinates,
and using default values for the remaining 0 coordinates:
 x = 99
 y = 91
 z = 90
Vector created without errors.
Vector 1:
[[ -77 -39 0 ]]
Vector 2:
[[ 99 91 90 ]]
Result of comparing [[ -77 -39 0 ]] and [[ 99 91 90 ]] for equality:
False
