Initializing Vector with 2 specified coordinates,
and using default values for the remaining 1 coordinates:
 x = -9
 y = -93
Vector created without errors.
Initializing Vector with 3 specified coordinates,
and using default values for the remaining 0 coordinates:
 x = -80
 y = 46
 z = 10
Vector created without errors.
Vector 1:
[[ -9 -93 0 ]]
Vector 2:
[[ -80 46 10 ]]
Result of comparing [[ -9 -93 0 ]] and [[ -80 46 10 ]] for equality:
False
