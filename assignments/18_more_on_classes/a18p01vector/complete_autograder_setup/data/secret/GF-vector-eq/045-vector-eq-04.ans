Initializing Vector with 1 specified coordinates,
and using default values for the remaining 2 coordinates:
 x = -94
Vector created without errors.
Initializing Vector with 2 specified coordinates,
and using default values for the remaining 1 coordinates:
 x = 7
 y = 7
Vector created without errors.
Vector 1:
[[ -94 0 0 ]]
Vector 2:
[[ 7 7 0 ]]
Result of comparing [[ -94 0 0 ]] and [[ 7 7 0 ]] for equality:
False
