Initializing Vector with 1 specified coordinates,
and using default values for the remaining 2 coordinates:
 x = 60
Vector created without errors.
Initializing Vector with 1 specified coordinates,
and using default values for the remaining 2 coordinates:
 x = -90
Vector created without errors.
Vector 1:
[[ 60 0 0 ]]
Vector 2:
[[ -90 0 0 ]]
Result of comparing [[ 60 0 0 ]] and [[ -90 0 0 ]] for equality:
False
