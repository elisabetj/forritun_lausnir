Initializing Vector with 3 specified coordinates,
and using default values for the remaining 0 coordinates:
 x = 80
 y = 84
 z = -34
Vector created without errors.
Initializing Vector with 2 specified coordinates,
and using default values for the remaining 1 coordinates:
 x = 95
 y = 41
Vector created without errors.
Vector 1:
[[ 80 84 -34 ]]
Vector 2:
[[ 95 41 0 ]]
Result of comparing [[ 80 84 -34 ]] and [[ 95 41 0 ]] for equality:
False
