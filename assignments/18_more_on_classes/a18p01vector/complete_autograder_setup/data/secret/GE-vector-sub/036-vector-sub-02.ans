Initializing Vector with 1 specified coordinates,
and using default values for the remaining 2 coordinates:
 x = -1
Vector created without errors.
Initializing Vector with 2 specified coordinates,
and using default values for the remaining 1 coordinates:
 x = -35
 y = 53
Vector created without errors.
Vector 1:
[[ -1 0 0 ]]
Vector 2:
[[ -35 53 0 ]]
Result of subtracting [[ -1 0 0 ]] from [[ -35 53 0 ]]:
[[ 34 -53 0 ]]
