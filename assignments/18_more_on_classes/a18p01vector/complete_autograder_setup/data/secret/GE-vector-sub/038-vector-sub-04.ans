Initializing Vector with 2 specified coordinates,
and using default values for the remaining 1 coordinates:
 x = -17
 y = 66
Vector created without errors.
Initializing Vector with 1 specified coordinates,
and using default values for the remaining 2 coordinates:
 x = 81
Vector created without errors.
Vector 1:
[[ -17 66 0 ]]
Vector 2:
[[ 81 0 0 ]]
Result of subtracting [[ -17 66 0 ]] from [[ 81 0 0 ]]:
[[ -98 66 0 ]]
