Initializing Vector with 1 specified coordinates,
and using default values for the remaining 2 coordinates:
 x = 4
Vector created without errors.
Initializing Vector with 3 specified coordinates,
and using default values for the remaining 0 coordinates:
 x = 98
 y = 31
 z = -45
Vector created without errors.
Vector 1:
[[ 4 0 0 ]]
Vector 2:
[[ 98 31 -45 ]]
Result of subtracting [[ 4 0 0 ]] from [[ 98 31 -45 ]]:
[[ -94 -31 45 ]]
