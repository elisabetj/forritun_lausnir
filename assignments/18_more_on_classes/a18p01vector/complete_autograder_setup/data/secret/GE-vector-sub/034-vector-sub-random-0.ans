Initializing Vector with 2 specified coordinates,
and using default values for the remaining 1 coordinates:
 x = -10
 y = 74
Vector created without errors.
Initializing Vector with 0 specified coordinates,
and using default values for the remaining 3 coordinates:
Vector created without errors.
Vector 1:
[[ -10 74 0 ]]
Vector 2:
[[ 0 0 0 ]]
Result of subtracting [[ -10 74 0 ]] from [[ 0 0 0 ]]:
[[ -10 74 0 ]]
