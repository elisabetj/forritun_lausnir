Initializing Vector with 2 specified coordinates,
and using default values for the remaining 1 coordinates:
 x = 13
 y = 43
Vector created without errors.
Initializing Vector with 3 specified coordinates,
and using default values for the remaining 0 coordinates:
 x = -84
 y = 14
 z = -98
Vector created without errors.
Vector 1:
[[ 13 43 0 ]]
Vector 2:
[[ -84 14 -98 ]]
Result of subtracting [[ 13 43 0 ]] from [[ -84 14 -98 ]]:
[[ 97 29 98 ]]
