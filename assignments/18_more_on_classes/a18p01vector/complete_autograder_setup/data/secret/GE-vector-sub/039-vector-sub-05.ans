Initializing Vector with 2 specified coordinates,
and using default values for the remaining 1 coordinates:
 x = 16
 y = -65
Vector created without errors.
Initializing Vector with 1 specified coordinates,
and using default values for the remaining 2 coordinates:
 x = 12
Vector created without errors.
Vector 1:
[[ 16 -65 0 ]]
Vector 2:
[[ 12 0 0 ]]
Result of subtracting [[ 16 -65 0 ]] from [[ 12 0 0 ]]:
[[ 4 -65 0 ]]
