Title: Clock

Implement a class called Clock with the following attributes:

- An __init__() method with three parameters: hours, minutes, seconds with default values 0.
- Three instance variables to store the hours, minutes and seconds.
- A method called str_update().
  It takes as an argument a string of the form hh:mm:ss and updates the three instances variables.
- A __str__() method for responding to the print() method. It should write out: "{} hours, {} minutes and {} seconds."
- A method called add_clocks().
  It takes another clock object as a parameter, adds the two clocks and returns a new clock instance.
  In this method, you need to add the respective values of the two clocks together and remember the resulting hours, minutes and seconds.
  Remember that the sum of seconds cannot exceed 60, in which case there is a carry over to the minutes values.
  Same for minutes, it cannot exceed 60 and carries over to hours.
  For hours, the summed values cannot exceed 24.
  If hours is exceeded, we ignore it and start from zero.
  Use the divmod() built-in Python function in your implementation.

Example use of class:

    clock1 = Clock()
    clock2 = Clock(8, 30)
    print(clock1)
    print(clock2)
    clock1.str_update("03:21:34")
    clock2.str_update("05:45:52")
    print(clock1)
    print(clock2)
    clock3 = clock1.add_clocks(clock2)
    print(clock3)

Corresponding output:

    0 hours, 0 minutes and 0 seconds.
    8 hours, 30 minutes and 0 seconds.
    3 hours, 21 minutes and 34 seconds.
    5 hours, 45 minutes and 52 seconds.
    9 hours, 7 minutes and 26 seconds.

Another example:

    clock1 = Clock(20, 10, 52)
    clock2 = Clock()
    clock2.str_update("08:49:24")
    print(clock1)
    print(clock2)
    clock3 = clock1.add_clocks(clock2)
    print(clock3)

Corresponding output:

    20 hours, 10 minutes and 52 seconds.
    8 hours, 49 minutes and 24 seconds.
    5 hours, 0 minutes and 16 seconds.
