\problemname{Budget}

You are a member of the newly formed Mars colonization effort. Your job is to budget for three projects: the cloud seeding project, the equatorial magnetizer, and the space elevator. Given a budget, and the cost of the three projects, determine if all projects can be started immediately.

\section*{Input}
Input consists of four lines. \\
The first line consists of one integer $b$, the budget. $-10^6 \leq b \leq 10^6$ \\
The second line consists of one integer $p_1$, the cost of the cloud seeding project. $-10^6 \leq p_1 \leq 10^6$ \\
The third line consists of one integer $p_2$, the cost of the equatorial magnetizer project. $-10^6 \leq p_2 \leq 10^6$ \\
The fourth line consists of one integer $p_3$, the cost of space elevator project. $-10^6 \leq p_3 \leq 10^6$ \\

\section*{Output}
If all projects can be started immediately, print \texttt{Budget is sufficient.}, else print \texttt{Budget is insufficient.}
