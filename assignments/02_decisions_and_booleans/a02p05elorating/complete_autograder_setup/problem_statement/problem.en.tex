\problemname{Elo Rating}

In chess, players are rated using the Elo system.
The system is designed such that if a player has 100 more Elo than the opponent,
then the player will win 64\% of the time.
Elo rankings can be split into multiple categories.
\begin{itemize}
	\item A super grandmaster has $\geq 2700$ Elo.
	\item A grandmaster has $\geq 2500$ Elo.
	\item A international grandmaster has $\geq 2400$ Elo.
	\item Let's call a chess player with $<2400$ Elo amateur.
\end{itemize}
Ratings are considered valid if they are $>999$. \\
Write a program that reads in a chess Elo rating and prints
\texttt{Super grandmaster},
\texttt{Grandmaster},
\texttt{International grandmaster},
\texttt{Amateur} or
\texttt{Invalid}
depending on the input.

\section*{Input}

where $-10^6 \leq rating \leq 10^6$.

\section*{Output}
