\problemname{Leap Year}

A year is 365 days, which is the time it takes for the Earth to go one revolution around the Sun... almost.

To account for this discrepancy, an additional day is added into the year every few years.

Luckily there exists an algorithm to check if a year is a leap year.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item If the year is evenly divisible by 4, go to step 2. Otherwise, go to step 5.
	\item If the year is evenly divisible by 100, go to step 3. Otherwise, go to step 4.
	\item If the year is evenly divisible by 400, go to step 4. Otherwise, go to step 5.
	\item The year is a leap year (it has 366 days).
	\item The year is not a leap year (it has 365 days).
\end{enumerate}
Write a program that, given a year, checks if the year is a leap year.

\section*{Input}
Input consists of one line containing one integer $y$, the year to check, where $-10^6 < y < 10^6$

\section*{Output}
Output consists of one line containing \texttt{True} if the year is a leap year, otherwise \texttt{False}
