\problemname{Quadratic Equation}

A quadratic equation has the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ for any arbitrary $a, b, \text{ and } c$. To check whether the equation has a real solution or not, the quadratic formula for the discriminant is used. The formula for the discriminant (ísl: aðgreinir) is given as $d = b^2 - 4ac$.
\begin{itemize}
	\item If $d > 0$ then the quadratic equation has 2 real solutions.
	\item If $d = 0$ then the quadratic equation has 1 real solutions.
	\item If $d < 0$ then the quadratic equation has 0 real solutions.
\end{itemize}

Write a program that finds how many solutions a given quadratic equation has.
