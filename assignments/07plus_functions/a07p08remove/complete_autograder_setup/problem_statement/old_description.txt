Title: Remove

In order to move a disc, we need to remove it from one location and insert it at another.
For example, imagine that all the discs are on the first pillar and we want to move the smallest disc to the third pillar.
That means that we would like to change our state representation from "321|||" to "32||1|" by moving the "1" within the string.
The code to achieve that could look something like this:

# state is "321|||"
where_to_remove = find_index_of_nth_occurrence(sequence=state, element_to_find="|", occurrence=1) - 1
state, disc_to_move = remove_at(sequence=state, index_to_remove=where_to_remove)
where_to_insert = find_index_of_nth_occurrence(sequence=state, element_to_find="|", occurrence=3)
state = insert_at(sequence=state, index=where_to_insert, element=disc_to_move)
# state is now "32||1|"

In this exercise, you will implement the 'remove_at' function.
It is a bit special in that it returns two values;
the updated sequence (string) and the element (character) that was removed.

In [12]: updated_sequence, removed_element = remove_at(sequence="321|||", index_to_remove=2)

In [13]: print(updated_sequence)
32|||

In [14]: print(removed_element)
1
