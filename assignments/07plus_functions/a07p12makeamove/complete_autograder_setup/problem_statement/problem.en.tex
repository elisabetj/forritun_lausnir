\problemname{Make a move}

Now we can implement the function \texttt{move\_one(from, to, state)},
that moves a single disc from one pillar to another,
using the functions that we have already created.

\textbf{Note that we are testing your code differently in this task,
please only submit your function definitions, without any code outside the functions!}

\section*{Input}
The function recieves three parameters,
an integer $f$, the pillar we are moving from,
an integer $t$, the pillar we are moving to,
and a sequence $s$ representing the state of the game.

In the tests, $f$ will be restricted to $1 \le f \le 3$,
$t$ will be restricted to $1 \le t \le 3$,
and $s$ will be a string with $4 \le |s| < 12$.

It is good if your function also works for other types of sequences and elements,
or for input outside these specifications,
but that is not part of the requirements.

In the samples below,
the first line of the input contains the integer $f$,
the second line of the input contains the integer $t$,
and the third line contains the string $s$.

\section*{Output}

The function should return a sequence $s'$,
identical to the input sequence $s$
except with the top element of pillar $f$ 
moved to the top of pillar $t$.
In particular, given a string $s$ as input, $s'$ should also be a string.

Thus, the function should return the new state of the game
after having made one move.

In the samples below,
the first and only line of the output contains the sequence $s'$.
