Title: Pulling levers for coins

Add the following functionality to tiles (1,2), (2,2), (2,3) and (3,2):

When the player enters these tiles, offer them the choice to pull a lever.
If they choose to pull the lever (answering either with ‘y’ or ‘Y’/ ‘N’ or ‘n’), they are to be told that they received one coin.

There is no limit on how often the player can get a coin from each lever.
But they should only be presented with the option to pull a lever once each time they are in a particular room.
So if they want to be asked again, they must first go away (to another tile) and come back.
Picking an invalid direction (walking into a wall) does not count as leaving the room.

In addition, you need to keep track of the number of coins the player has and display that before showing the available actions.

When a victory has been reached, the program also prints out how many coins the player retrieved.

Example run:

    You can travel: (N)orth.
    Direction: s
    Not a valid direction!
    You can travel: (N)orth.
    Direction: n
    Pull a lever (y/n): y
    You received 1 coin, your total is now 1.
    You can travel: (N)orth or (E)ast or (S)outh.
    Direction: N
    You can travel: (E)ast or (S)outh.
    Direction: w
    Not a valid direction!
    You can travel: (E)ast or (S)outh.
    Direction: E
    Pull a lever (y/n): n
    You can travel: (E)ast or (W)est.
    Direction: e
    You can travel: (S)outh or (W)est.
    Direction: s
    Pull a lever (y/n): y
    You received 1 coin, your total is now 2.
    You can travel: (N)orth or (S)outh.
    Direction: S
    Victory! Total coins 2.
