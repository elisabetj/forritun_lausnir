Title: Play multiple times

In the next version, the program should allow the user to play the game multiple times.
Once the player obtains a victory, the user is asked if he/she wants to play again.
As long as the answer is ‘y’ or ‘Y’, the game continues.
Note that when the game is played again, the coin counter is reset.

In this part, you need to make sure that your main program is short,
i.e. that it only contains the main loop and a call to a play() function.
