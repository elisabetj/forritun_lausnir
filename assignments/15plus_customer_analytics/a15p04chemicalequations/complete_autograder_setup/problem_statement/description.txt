Title: Chemical equations

When balancing a chemical equation, a necessary requirement is that
all the elements appearing on one side of the equation
must also appear on the other side of the equation.

Write a program that prompts the user for a chemical equation,
and checks if the same elements appear on both sides of the equation.

You should be able to reuse some functions from the previous exercise,
but here, each side of the equation can include more than one formula,
so you'll probably need to split the equation into individual formulae
before feeding them to your pre-existing functions.

Example input/output:

    Enter a chemical equation: H20 + Fe <=> FeO3H3 + H2
    No elements missing from either side of the equation.

Another example:

    Enter a chemical equation: Cl2 + KOH <=> KCl
    The following elements appear on the left side but not the right:
     H, O
    Therefore, balancing this chemical equation is not possible.
