I/O tests:

Test case 1:
Points: 2

Input:
PbN6 + CrMn2O8 <=> Cr2O3 + MnO2 + Pb3O4 + N2

Output:
Enter a chemical equation: No elements missing from either side of the equation.


Test case 2:
Points: 3

Input:
KClO3 + PbN6 + CrMn2O8 <=> Cr2O3 + MnO2 + Pb3O4 + N2 + C6H12O6

Output:
Enter a chemical equation: The following elements appear on the left side but not the right:
 Cl, K
The following elements appear on the right side but not the left:
 C, H
Therefore, balancing this chemical equation is not possible.
