Title: Customer Analytics

Your stupendously awesome internet startup, where-my-sock.is, has come out of stealth-mode.
For the past few months you have actual paying customers!
You want to hire another software engineer but [your wife](strikethrough) the chairman of the board
insists that you grow your customer base to 1000 monthly active users before hiring more people.

You decide to engage with your existing users in an attempt to meet that target. You put together the following plan:

1. Identify premium customers, the die-hard fans who come back each and every month. Offer them swag (where-my-sock.is baseball caps, t-shirts, fridge magnets) in exchange for referrals and testimonials.
2. Identify new customers who signed up last month. Send them a personalized welcome email to improve odds of retaining them.
3. Identify dormant customers who have not used your service for the last 2 months. Send them a nudge email to try to get them back.

You generate a .csv file based on customer activity in your system. It looks something like this:

    2020-07,Conrad Brown
    2020-07,Leroy Simpson
    2020-07,Eleanor Perkins
    2020-08,Eleanor Perkins
    2020-08,Conrad Brown
    2020-09,Conrad Brown
    2020-09,Gertrude Padilla
    2020-09,Eleanor Perkins
    2020-09,Gertrude Padilla

There are two columns in the file, the year and month in which the activity took place and the name of the customer.

In this example, we can see that:

- Conrad Brown and Eleanor Perkins are premium customers. They have used the product in each and every month.
- Gertrude Padilla is a new customer. She used the product twice last month.
- Leroy Simpson is a dormant customer. He hasn't used the product in the last two months.

You know that you can leverage your Python chops to read this file and print out the three customer segments.
You want the program to generate output that looks like this (given the .csv example above).

    Premium customers
    ----------------------------------------
    Conrad Brown
    Eleanor Perkins

    New customers
    ----------------------------------------
    Gertrude Padilla

    Dormant customers
    ----------------------------------------
    Leroy Simpson


Other requirements:

- The program should read data from a file named active_customers_by_month.csv
- The program should continue to produce correct results, even when fed data covering more months than in the example above.
- Customer names should be in alphabetical order.
