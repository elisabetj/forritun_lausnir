Title: Chemical formulae

Write a program that prompts the user for two chemical formulae.
The program should call a function and transform each chemical formula string into a set
of chemical components. For example CaSO4 -> {Ca, S, O}.
The program should then display common components in each of the formulae

Example input/output:

    Enter a chemical formula: NaNO3
    Enter another chemical formula: NaHCO3
    Na, O

Hint: Chemical components always start off with 1 or 2 letters, the first being uppercase, and the second being lowercase.
