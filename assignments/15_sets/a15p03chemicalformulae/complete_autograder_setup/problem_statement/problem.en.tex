\problemname{Chemical Formulae}
Write a program that, given two chemical formulae,
transforms each chemical formula string into a set of chemical components.
For example $CaSO4 \rightarrow \{Ca, S, O\}$.
The program should then display common components in each of the formulae. \\

\section*{Input}
The program receives two lines as input.
The first and second line each contain one formula.

A formulae is defined as a series of chemical components each possibly followed by a number.\\
Chemical components always start off with 1 or 2 English letters, the first being uppercase, and the second being lowercase.

In the tests the length of each formulae will be restricted to $1$ to $300$.

\section*{Output}
Output consists of one line. 
The common elements in the two formulae each seperated by a comma and a space.
The elements should be output in lexicographical order.
