\problemname{Prime Number}

A prime number is a whole number greater than $1$ whose only factors are $1$ and itself.

Advanced hint: To speed up your program you can make use of the fact that divisors come in pairs.
That is if an integer $i$ divides an integer $n$, then $\frac{n}{i}$ also divides $n$.
Also note that as $i$ becomes larger, $\frac{n}{i}$ becomes smaller.

\section*{Input}
Input consists of one line containing one integer $n$, where $1 \leq n \leq 10^6$.

\section*{Output}
Output \texttt{prime} if $n$ is prime, otherwise output \texttt{not prime}.
