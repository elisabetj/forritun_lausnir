\problemname{Legendre's Conjecture}

A conjecture is a proposition or conclusion based upon incomplete information to which no proof has been found.
In other words, it has neither been proved nor disproved.

Legendre's Conjecture states that there is always at least one prime number between any two consecutive natural numbers' squares.
Write a program that prompts for an integer $n$. Then, using a while loop, or while loops, it lists the primes between $n^2$ and $(n+1)^2$.
The conjecture has been verified for all $n$, where $1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^9$.

Hint: Use nested while loops.

Another hint: Reuse code you already wrote in the previous question.

\section*{Input}
Input consists of one line containing one integer $n$, where $1 \leq n \leq 300$.

\section*{Output}
Output all the prime numbers between $n$ and $n^2$ in ascending order, where each prime is on its own line.
