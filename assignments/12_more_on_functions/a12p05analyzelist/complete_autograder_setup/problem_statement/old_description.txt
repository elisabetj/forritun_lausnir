Title: Analyze list

Write a Python program that takes a list L of integers > 0 as input and prints out the following information:

1. The list L.
2. The sorted version of L.
3. A sorted list of the composite numbers in L (composite numbers are numbers that are not prime). The resulting list should only include each value once.
4. Minimum, maximum, and average values in L. The average value should be printed with two decimal places (with trailing zeros if necessary).

You are allowed to use list functions, but you are not allowed to import any module.
The function is_prime() is given.

You need to print out an error message if the user enters invalid values into the list,
and ask the user again for input until valid input is given.
See an example below.

    Enter integers separated with commas: 1,2,b
    Incorrect input! Please try again.
    Enter integers separated with commas: 1,2,-3
    Incorrect input! Please try again.
    Enter integers separated with commas: 2,5,7,2,8,10,34,23,9,4,5
    Input list: [2, 5, 7, 2, 8, 10, 34, 23, 9, 4, 5]
    Sorted list:  [2, 2, 4, 5, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 23, 34]
    Composite list:  [4, 8, 9, 10, 34]
    Min: 2, Max: 34, Average: 9.91
