Title: Get numbers from file

Write a program that prompts the user for a file,
repeatedly until the user enters a name of a file that actually exists,
and then extracts all numbers from the text file.
The results should be saved in a list and finally printed out in sorted order.

The file format used is:

    There are n numbers in this file.
    a (written form of a), b (written form of b), ...

Contents of an example file, called number_text.txt:

    There are 5 numbers in this file
    7 (Seven), 3 (Three), 10 (Ten), 1 (One), 77 (Seventyseven)

Given number_text.txt as input, the program should output:

    [1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 77]
