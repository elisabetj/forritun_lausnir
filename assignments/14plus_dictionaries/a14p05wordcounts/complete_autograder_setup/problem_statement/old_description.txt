Title: Word counts

Write a program that reads a text file,
keeps a count of the individual words in the file using a dictionary
and then groups the words by how often they appear,
and prints the words of each count (most frequent first).
The main program is given, do not change it.
Implement the remaining given functions.

Note that the counts are not case-sensitive, that is, 'Word' is the same as 'word' or 'wORd'.

Also, note that your program should account for if a punctuation (like a comma) appears at the end of a word,
meaning that word like 'university' and 'university,' are the same word.

Example input file:

    I do not think there is any thrill that can go through the human heart,
    like that felt by the inventor as he sees some creation of the brain
    unfolding to success.
    Such emotions make a man forget food, sleep, friends, love, everything.
    Nikola Tesla

Input/output:

Name of file: There's only 1 word that appears 3 times:
 the
There's only 1 word that appears 2 times:
 that
There are 40 words that appear 1 times:
 i, do, not, think, there, is, any, thrill, can, go, through, human, heart, like, felt, by, inventor, as, he, sees, some, creation, of, brain, unfolding, to, success, such, emotions, make, a, man, forget, food, sleep, friends, love, everything, nikola, tesla
