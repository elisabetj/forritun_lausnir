Title: Part I

The teacher will implement this part with your help.
Make sure that you also do the implementation on your own computer.

In this first part, the purpose of the program is to display another view of the data, i.e. by grouping the data by country.
The output should look like the following:

Players by country:

The number in parenthesis are the number of players in each group and the average chess ratings in each group.
When printing the chess player name and rating, use this format: {:>40}{:>10}

In addition to the above requirement,
you should make sure that your program can easily look up a given chess player
and display his/her attributes (rank, country, rating, birth year),
even though that functionality is not part of the current requirements.
