Title: Validate name and age

Write a program that includes two functions, get_name() and get_age().

The get_name() function should prompt the user: "What's your name? "
If the user enters an empty string or there is a number in the string,
the function should print:
    Please enter a valid name.
It should keep asking until the user supplies a valid name, and return the given name.

The get_age() function should prompt the user: "How old are you? ".
If the user inputs a string, the function should print:
    Please enter an integerâ€‹.
If the user inputs a number not in the range 0-125 (inclusive) the function should print:
    You seriously expect me to believe you are {age} years old?
It should keep asking until the user supplies a valid age, and return the given age.

The program should call both these functions and print out:
    Nice to meet you {name}. Congratulations on your {age} years.
where {name} is the value returned from get_name() and {age} is the value returned from get_age().
