Title: Reverse words

Write a program that takes a filename as input. The program should open that file and print every single word in that file backwards.
If the input file looks like this:
    Dear diary, today I made a friend​.
The output should look like this: 
    raeD ,yraid yadot I edam a .dneirf​

Note: Do not change the original file and do not write a new file with the words reversed, simply print the reversed words.

Note: For each line in the file, you should print one line to the output.
