\problemname{Reverse words}

Write a program that takes a filename as input. The program should open that file and print every single word in that file backwards.

\textbf{Note:} Do not change the original file and do not write a new file with the words reversed, simply print the reversed words.

\textbf{Note:} For each line in the file, you should print one line to the output.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item A filename containing the text to be processed.

The file is guaranteed to exist and be accessible by the given name.

\section*{Output}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The content of the file with every single word reversed, where each line in the input corresponds to one line in the output.
\end{enumerate}
