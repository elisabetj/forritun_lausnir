# You'll often see the following two lines at the bottom of python files.
# This is a good way of setting up the program.
# It checks if this file is being run as the main program.
#
# Python modules have a special attribute called __name__,
# which indicates whether the file is being run as the main program,
# or being imported into another module.
#
# If it is being run, then its __name__ attribute will be "__main__".
# But if it is being imported, it's __name__ will be the name of the .py file.
#
# In case it is being imported, we don't want to run any functions, just import their names.
# But if it is being run, then we call the main() function to start the program.
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
